        <h2>Bachelor of Software Engineering (Hons)</h2>
        <img src="se1.png" alt="">
        <h2>About Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>Software engineering is the structured, methodical process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It entails creating high-quality software that satisfies user needs by utilising theories and methods from engineering, computer science, and project management. 
            Consider it a method for producing software that is stable, scalable, and efficient. Software engineering is fundamentally the application of concepts and methods from computer science, engineering, and project management to the development of effective, dependable, and scalable software. Software developers first gather requirements, working with stakeholders to determine what the programme must perform and the issues it must resolve.
            A rapidly moving discipline, software engineering is always adjusting to new technology and shifting user needs. Software engineers must therefore be lifelong learners who are at ease with new technologies and flexible enough to adjust to changing requirements.</p>
            <h2>Programme Overview</h2>
        <p>Software systems have become the cornerstone of all modern businesses. 
            These systems are often complex yet must be robust and adaptable. 
            This programme will equip you with the knowledge and understanding of user requirements 
            in analysing, modelling, designing, and developing large-scale software systems that are reliable and robust. Such Software Engineering (SE) specialists will be able to respond to the ever growing impact of large-scale software systems in a wide range of situations, as well as to the increased importance in safety-critical and mission-critical applications. With the technical content gained as well as the practical aspects of architecture design, software development, software processes, software project management, software testing and software maintenance issues, you will be prepared to meet challenges of the industry and have the competency to develop new and innovative solutions. The three-month internship incorporated into the programme, will provide you with the opportunity to apply theories in practice and prepare you to enter the workforce. </p>
